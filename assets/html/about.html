<p>Version 1.0</p>
<h1>Web TTS</h1>
WebTTS is free and open source talking browser for Android. It is optimized to read articles of news websites so you can enjoy the latest news. It uses Androids text to speech engine. This is very use full if you are e.g. driving your car.

<h2>Reading content</h2>
Note, this app is optimized for websites with a simple structure: A list of articles and the article. There is no possibility to navigate through the website (if you want to, please stop the car and use <i>your</i> browser - navigation will cost too much attention).

The app will try to find all links to articles based on some common (simple) rules. It will also try to find the content of an article. It that doesn't work, please get in touch with me. I'll try to improve the rules. Aside that, there is a google doc spreadsheet containing content selector overrides. I'll update that document as soon as possible.
